\subsection{Total energy calculation}
There are two main ways of computing the total energy of the system.
\\The obious one, which we already encountered, is to evaluate the integral of the energy density.
\begin{equation*}
    E[\Psi] = \bra{\Psi} \hat{H} \ket{\Psi} = \int \mathcal H (\mathbf r) d^3\mathbf r
\end{equation*}
On the other hand, at a local minimum, following equation \ref{eq:energy_variation}, we get
\begin{equation}
    \bra{\Psi} \hat{H} \ket{\Psi} = \sum_{\alpha} \varepsilon_\alpha
\end{equation}
