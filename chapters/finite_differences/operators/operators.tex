\subsection{Quantum operators in finite differences}
Our method of solving an eigenvalue problem is blind to the physics and important aspects regarding symmetries and quantum numbers.
\\To better understand the system we are dealing with, we need to calculate certain quantities, like angular momentum (orbital and total), parity, and so on.
\\Quantum operators act on a specific Hilbert space, which in our case is either the position space or the spin space.
