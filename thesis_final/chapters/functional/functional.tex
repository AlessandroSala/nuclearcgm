\chapter{Energy functional}
The energy functional we want to minimize is rather complex, due to the rich phenomenology of nuclear interactions and numerical nuances.
\\The complete energy functional is
\begin{equation}
\label{eq:full_functional}
E_{\text{HF}} = E_\text{Skyrme}+E_\text{Coul} + E_\text{Kin}
\end{equation}
We'll begin by looking at the Skyrme and kinetic parts, while later on give a treatment for the Coulomb one.
