  abstract = {An empirical analysis is made of the mean effective internucleon potential required in the shell-model description of nuclei, allowing for the presence of many-body effects as suggested by current theory. A consistent description is found in which the effective two-body interaction acts almost entirely in even states, and the many-body effects are simulated by a repulsive three-body contact interaction. The strength of the two-body interaction is consistent with that expressed by the free scattering matrix of the two-nucleon system, and that of the three-body interaction with the ‘rearrangement energy’ calculated in the many-body theory.}

  abstract = {Skyrme effective forces are revisited to improve their behavior with respect to the isospin degree of freedom from the stability line to the most exotic nuclei that coming experimental facilities will produce. To achieve the best possible calculation of nuclear properties up to the neutron drip line, it is proposed to fit the neutron matter equation of state of the UV14+UVII theoretical model up to high densities to avoid any collapses or unphysical features of the resulting equation of state in the Skyrme framework. This last and very severe constraint on these interactions allows a prospective study of both neutron rich nuclei and neutron star matter.}
